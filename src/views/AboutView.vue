      and created by <a href="mailto:max.ionov (secret symbol) gmail.com">Max Ionov</a>.</p>
    <p>
      We were doing this from the command line and a bunch of Jupyter notebooks for years but at some point
      thought that maybe other there are others who can benefit from this.
      There are plenty of things we want to add, so stay tuned if you are interested.</p>

    <p>
      If you:
      <ul>
        <li>use this, or</li>
        <li>want to use this, or</li>
        <li>would like to use this but something is missing â€”</li>
      </ul>
      drop us a line, we want to know more.</p>
    <p>And if you found an error or have an idea for an improvement,
